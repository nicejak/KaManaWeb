# Ka mana o ka Ä«a: Modeling our Energy Future
The Ka Mana team is a collaboration between three major code groups to address multiple Earthshots climate issues with applied mathematics and computer science. At its core is the general finite element method code [PISALE (Pacific Island Structured adaptive mesh refinement with Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian)](https://pisale.bitbucket.io/). It uses numerical techniques to model problems associated with Earthshots goals.

## DOE's Energy Earthshots
The DOE's Energy Earthshots initiative drives research in climate change and clean energy solutions. The Ka Mana team focuses on three Earthshots programs:

* Offshore wind turbines.
* Enchanced geothermal energy.
* Hydrogen energy.
* Long duration energy storage and crosscutting.
