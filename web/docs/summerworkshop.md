# Earthshots Summer Intensive Workshop at the University of Hawai'i
As part of the Earthshots grant, the team is arranging a numerical methods and high-performance computing workshop with a focus on Earthshots applications, theoretical mathematics, and computational mathematics. Student interns will collaborate with university faculty and computational laboratory experts to solve hands-on problem solving sessions.

In a collaboration with the UH Information Technology Service Cyberinfrastructure and HOCc cluster KOA, UH Data Sciences Institute, and UH MƒÅnoa's Laboratory for Advanced Visualization & Applications, the first years summer workshop will take place May 13 to May 17 at the Kahuku Wind Farm on Oahu. Current student applicants have a variety of backgrounds such as engineering, atmospheric science, computer and information science, and mathematics.
