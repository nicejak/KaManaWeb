At its core is the general-purpose code PISALE (Pacific Island Structured adaptive mesh refinement with Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian). It uses numerical techniques to model problems associated with Earthshots goals.</p> <p>Alongside it is the AMReX code, a block-structured adaptive mesh refinement framework with support for hierarchical mesh and particle data with embedded boundaries. The ARMeX capabilities make it an excellent option for coupling with PISALE to model particles. So far, the team has began work coupling AMReX with PISALE. We still have to create and initialize ARMeX particle data containers in PISALE.</p> <p>Last but not least, the MFEM code uses the finite element method to solve partial differential equations on unstructured grids with high-order functions and flexible meshes. MFEM and PISALE coupling has been tested on subsurface flow and transport and an on-going NSF project successfully. </p>"},{"location":"#does-energy-earthshots","title":"DOE's Energy Earthshots","text":"<p>The DOE's Energy Earthshots initiative drives research in climate change and clean energy solutions.
